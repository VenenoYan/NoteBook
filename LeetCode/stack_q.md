#232. Implement Queue using Stacks
Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.

push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.<br>
pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.<br>
peek() -- Get the front element.<br>
empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.<br>

You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
